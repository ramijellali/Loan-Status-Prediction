📊 Data Collection and Processing
The dataset used in this project contains valuable information about loan applicants, such as income, education, marital status, and more. The dataset can be found on Kaggle at the following link:

(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ninzaami/loan-predication)

Data preprocessing steps include handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and other necessary transformations to prepare the data for model training.

📈 Data Visualization
Data visualization is a key part of this project. Various plots and charts are used to explore the dataset, identify trends, and better understand the distribution of features. This step helps in selecting and engineering features for the model.

🧠 Model Training
The model of choice for this project is the Support Vector Machine (SVM). The data is split into training and testing sets, and the model is trained on the training data. Hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation are applied to enhance the model's performance.

📉 Evaluation
The model's effectiveness is evaluated using the test set. Key metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are calculated and visualized to assess the performance.

🚀 Usage
To use this project:

Ensure all dependencies are installed.
Run the Jupyter notebook or Python script provided in the repository.
Input the necessary data features to receive a prediction on loan status.
